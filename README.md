# Easy-Bank-Landing-Page

Hey there, 
- This is a **responsive front-end webpage** that is mostly made up of **HTML** and **CSS** (including **SASS** ofc).
- This is also auto-scaled, which means the layout changes with the window size you're viewing it i.e. appears differntly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- This is a challenge from frontendmentor, you can view it [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN).
- All thanks to the tutorials on youtube on web dev, they've been used extensively in making this project XD.
